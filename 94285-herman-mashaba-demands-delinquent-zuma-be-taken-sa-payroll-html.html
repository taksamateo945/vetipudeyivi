According to Mashaba, Zuma, who refuses to attend the commission, should be stripped of his privileges as a former South African president.</p>"If #Zuma is intent on defying the supreme law of our land, Parliament must act swiftly to remove the benefits he and his family enjoy as a Former President. Tax payers cannot continue to fit the bill for a lavish life of a Constitutional Delinquent. @ParliamentofRSA," he wrote.<p class=align-left>Sooner than later many South Africans were in the comment section sharing their thoughts on the matter. While some agreed a few stood by Zuma's side. Read a few of their interesting and insightful comments below.</p><p class=align-left>@Azania_Mhayise said:</p>"I really would vote for you but your obsession with Zuma is boring. How about you focus on Action SA and leave Zuma alone."<p class=align-left>@kevan_logic said:</p>"In his mind, he is the supreme law of the land. What does he know? He has dirt on many people... maybe if he just came out and released the Kraken it would change everything. But still, we live in hope."<p class=align-left>@lesmakhen said:</p>"Let us not degrade and compare ourselves with apartheid leaders. Zuma was democratically elected and should act with dignity and integrity and respect the rule of law."<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/8907f5682b5e131c.png><p class=align-left><strong>We </strong>earlier reported that former president Jacob Zuma has announced that <a href=#>he would rather go to prison than cooperate with the State Capture Commission</a>. Zuma said he would not longer cooperate with the Zondo Commission as long as Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo is still its chair.</p><p class=align-left>In a statement he released on Monday, Zuma shared that he would not abide by the Constitutional Court's recent "extraordinary and unprecedented" judgement that compelled him to appear before the commission.</p><p class=align-left>In the statement shared by EWN online, Zuma shared that he is the target of propaganda, vilification and falsified claims for his stance on the transformation of <a href=#>Mzansi</a> and the economy.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Enjoyed reading our story?

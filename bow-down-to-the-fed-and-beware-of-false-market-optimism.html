Anything that brings down inflation, including tough statements from [Fed Chair] Jay Powell, will make big institutional money managers more likely to buy stocks rather than sell them. For the moment, that’s what controls the stock market,” added Cramer, <a href=#>who defended Powell against critics</a> on Monday.</p><p>Cramer’s comments come a day after the Fed Chair Jerome Powell <a href=#>vowed to take aggressive action</a> against inflation, including possibly implementing half-basis point interest increases, a week after instituting the first rate hike in over three years.</p><p>A company that has high stock prices won’t necessarily stay that way in a volatile market, even if it is performing well, Cramer said.</p><p>“There are periods, extreme periods, where the economy gets so out of whack that the stock market itself becomes a pariah asset class, a source of funds for other asset classes, so an individual company’s merits simply won’t be reflected in its share price,” Cramer said.</p><p>Cramer, who has touted a <a href=#>strategy of investing in profitable companies</a> for months, also advised investors to refrain from picking up uninvestable stocks like floundering IPOs and SPACs.</p><p>“Tons of those stocks just aren’t worth much, regardless of whether Powell steers us into a soft landing or a hard landing,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7OsGSdp6ejerW7jK2fnmWWmrFurc2dZJudp5a%2FpnnOn2SfmZyosm65wKuinqxdpL21tcyiqqZn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

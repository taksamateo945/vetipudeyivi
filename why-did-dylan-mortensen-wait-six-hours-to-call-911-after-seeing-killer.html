Internet Shocked As 'She Goe</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-06-25</div><p>Why Did Dylan Mortensen Wait SIX HOURS To Call 911 After Seeing Killer? MOSCOW, IDAHO: As the investigation into the murders in Idaho moves further, a crucial point remains unanswered. Why Dylan Mortensen, the surviving roommate, took so long to alert the authorities about the killings and why Bryan Kohberger targeted the four murdered Idaho students are the two main mysteries in this case.</p><p>Police reportedly turned over the file holding crucial details about the crime, according to Daily Mail. On January 5, following a brief court appearance in Moscow, he was also turned down for release. In connection with the deaths of Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Madison Mogen, 21, Ethan Chapin, 20, and Xana Kernodle, 20, the suspect was detained on December 30.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Internet is still confused about why Dylan took almost six hours of time to report to the police and why didn’t she react immediately.</p><h2>Why Did Dylan Mortensen Wait SIX HOURS To Call 911 After Seeing Killer?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/247newsaroundtheworld.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/dfa2b653-5384-405a-adef-de6d737997a5.JPG><p>Dylan is currently under pressure to answer why she took six hours to report the issue to 911 and inform the police. She lived through the attack with Bethany Funke. According to her, the suspect was dressed in all black with a mask covering his face and heard one of her housemates say, “there’s someone here.” The suspect said, “it’s ok, I’m here to help you.” The investigation team has confirmed that a 911 call was made by one of the surviving roommates at 11.58 am, who requested help for an unconscious person. One of the reasons that people claim is that she may have been “frozen by fear.” Mortensen claims that she was awoken at around 4 am when she could hear what sounded like victim Kaylee “playing with her dog” in a third-floor bedroom. Later, she felt the sound of Xana crying. Meanwhile, she encountered a tall figure with a mask on and full black attire. Though the killer came towards her, she was spared.</p><h2>Who Is Dylan Mortensen?</h2><p>Dylan Mortensen is one of the two roommates who were not injured during November 13, 2022, knife attack murders&nbsp;of four University of Idaho college students in their off-campus rental house.</p><p>Mortensen is mentioned by her initials D.M.&nbsp;in the police affidavit&nbsp;accusing graduate student&nbsp;Bryan Kohberger&nbsp;of murdering the students.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener external">His lawyer told TODAY</a>&nbsp;that Kohberger believes he will be “exonerated.”</p><p>The affidavit, which was released publicly on January 5, 2023, says that Mortensen saw the killer. However, 911 was not called until 11:58 a.m., hours later,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener external">the police website on the case says</a>. The affidavit says Mortensen froze and then locked her bedroom door.</p><p>In part, authorities used Mortensen’s observations to determine that the homicides occurred between 4 a.m. and 4:25 a.m., the affidavit says.</p><p>Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, and Madison Mogen, were stabbed to death in their off-campus rental home on November 13, 2022,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener external">police say</a>&nbsp;on their website. The police affidavit accuses Kohberger of stalking the students’ home 12 times and leaving behind a knife sheath with DNA on it. The affidavit does not provide a motive.</p><p>The other surviving roommate, Bethany Funke, does not feature in the affidavit as prominently as Mortensen does. Neither Mortensen nor Funke was attacked,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener external">police have said&nbsp;</a>in previous news releases.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener external">Videos about Mortensen</a>&nbsp;have had more than 24 million views on TikTok, as people discuss theories in the case.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener external">Under a section on their website</a>&nbsp;devoted to “who is NOT believed to be involved?” Moscow, Idaho, police wrote “Two surviving roommates.”</p><h2 class=split>Why were these four students targeted?</h2><p>There are minute details regarding how Kohberger killed the four victims. However, it still remains a matter of doubt why these four students were targeted. Officials have yet to confirm how he became aware of the students as he has been tracked all over this place. Another question that is yet to receive an answer is why he did not kill the dog of Kaylee whom she shared with her ex-boyfriend – Jack DuCoeur called Murphy. He has survived the attack and is with Jack. Another concern regarding the case is if police were concerned about spooking alleged killer Kohberger into fleeing after linking a vehicle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/247newsaroundtheworld.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/e12af987-dfb6-4b39-90be-9e2b30fe1fe1.jpeg><p>Meanwhile, one of the major concerns of the case is revolving the murder weapon and if the killer did the crime alone. Police have been finding it hard to spot the murder weapon. This even led the police to search for the weapon in the Inland North Waste and extensively checked garbage vehicles to seize the weapon, however, it was unsuccessful. When it comes to the killer having an accomplice to help during the murder, police chief James Fry stated, “We have an individual in custody who committed these horrible crimes,” and did not rule out the possibility of having multiple killers.</p><h2 class=split>‘Why didn’t anyone call police until noon the next day?’</h2><p>Netizens had various doubts and concerns regarding why Dylan took six hours to call 911. A user asked on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Reddit,</a>&nbsp;“The probable cause affidavit says the roommate saw the killer at 4am and then locked herself in her bedroom….Why didn’t anyone call police until Noon the next day? I’m baffled.” Another stated, “So she opens her door multiple times because of suspicious noises – including her roommate crying – finally peeks through the door and sees a MASKED MAN (presumably at this point covered in blood) fleeing and she…..locks her door and goes to sleep?. I’m just trying to understand. How does one do that?.”</p><p>A user added, “Right? Wouldn’t you at least try texting your roommates is you weee afraid to speak? I dunno. Something. I mean..she’s gotta live with it so I’m sure it’s worse for her than us but, she’s gotta know, we got questions!.” Another claimed, “So Dylan seen the killer and locks herself in her room and passes out, and Bethany calls the police. Hmm still seems a little crazy that someone could see a killer and then be so wasted passes out ? instead of being able to call police.”</p><p>A user explained, “She didn’t realize what had happened. She was shocked to see the guy leave but it never crossed her mind that there was a bloodbath. Guy w face covering at night in cold climate is not that weird. High traffic house one learns to disregard others’ business maybe.” “I wouldn’t assume bloodbath, but I would check on my roommates. Period. She was alarmed enough to keep opening her door and keep looking out. She was alarmed enough to immediately lock her door and hide in her room. But she wasn’t alarmed enough to…check on her roommates?I cannot fathom this. Cannot,” read a comment.</p><p>Another wondered, “I’ve been trying to make sense of this. Is it possible she thought it was the police about underage drinking and was scared to get found drunk? Or thought it was a burglar but was scared to call the police being drunk and underage? Is it possible she has a history of weird dreams and in the moment thought she was dreaming it? This is all I could come up with.”</p><p>Here’s what you need to know:</p><h2>1. Mortensen Heard Sounds the Morning of the Murders, the Affidavit Says</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dylan-mortenson-bethany-funke.jpg><p id=caption-attachment-3993147 class=wp-caption-text><span class=caption-credit>Instagram/Facebook</span>Dylan Mortensen and Bethany Funke</p><p>Funke’s room was on the first floor of the King Road residence, according to the affidavit. Mortensen’s bedroom was on the southeast side of the second floor, which is the floor where two of the victims, Chapin and Kernodle, were also sleeping.</p><p>The affidavit says both surviving roommates were interviewed by the police.</p><p>Funke told police she had seen Chapin and Kernodle that night at the Sigma Chi House from 9 p.m. through 1:45 a.m., the affidavit says. Goncalves and Mogen were at a local bar and then a food truck before arriving home at 1:56 p.m., it says.</p><p>By 4 a.m., all of the people in the house were in their rooms, the roommates told police, according to the affidavit.</p><p>The affidavit describes various sounds heard by Mortensen the morning of the murders. According to the affidavit, Mortensen, again identified only by her initials, woke up at 4 a.m. to what sounded like Goncalves playing with her dog in one of the upstairs bedrooms.</p><p>She heard a person she thought was Goncalves say something to the effect of “there’s someone here,” the affidavit says. This voice might actually have been Kernodle, who was probably on TikTok when the murders occurred around 4:12 a.m., the affidavit says.</p><p>Mortensen told police she looked out of her bedroom but did not see anything, according to the affidavit.</p><p>She opened the door a second time when she heard what she thought was crying coming from Kernodle’s room, it says, and then she heard a male voice say something to the effect of, “It’s okay, I’m going to help you.”</p><p>At 4:17 a.m., a security camera nearby picked up distorted audio of what “sounded like voices or a whimper followed by a loud thud, the affidavit says, and a dog can also be heard barking numerous times starting at 4:17 a.m.,” the affidavit says.</p><p>Mortensen told police she opened her door for the third time after she heard the crying and “saw a figure clad in black clothing and a mask that covered the person’s mouth and nose walking towards her. D.M. described the figure as 5’10” or taller, male, not very muscular, but athletically built with busy eyebrows,” the affidavit says.</p><p>He walked past her as she stood in “frozen shock phase” and walked back towards the back sliding glass door, it says.</p><p>“The male walked towards the back sliding glass door. D.M. locked herself in her room after seeing the male. D.M. did not state that she recognized the male. This leads investigators to believe that the murderer left the scene,” the affidavit says.</p><p>The affidavit then describes in great detail how police used video, cell phone, and DNA evidence to identify Kohberger as the suspect.</p><h2>2.

The 911 Call Was Made With the Phone of One of the Surviving Roommates, Police Say</h2><p>On November 19, 2022, Moscow police&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener external">wrote in a press release,</a>&nbsp;“The cell phone used to call 911 belonged to one of the surviving roommates.

"It was really emotional for me because I've been through a lot. I wasn't expecting to win. It totally caught me off guard."</p><p>In addition to landing a modeling contract and a spread in Italian Vogue, Ward walks away with a $100,000 Cover Girl cosmetics contract.</p><p>"I'm going to invest in my career," she told <strong>Us</strong>. "Like, going to New York or wherever they want to take me. I don't want to blow it. I might splurge on video games because I'm a nerd like that."</p><p>Ward's wafer-thin frame came under attack in August when a show promo featured judge <strong>Miss J Alexander</strong> putting his hands around her miniscule midsection.&nbsp;"You have the smallest waist in the world," host <strong>Tyra Banks</strong> told her. "Look at that waist!" (Banks, 37, later said she was "sorry for the style in which the Top Model promo clip was presented.")</p><p>The hoopla likely didn't faze Ward, who has said she was scrutinized for her unusual appearance when she was younger.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I feel way more confident than before, but I know that I have more work to do," she told <strong>Us</strong> after her big win.</p><p>Has she gotten a positive reaction from anyone who used to tease her?</p><p>"I haven't had anyone apologize to me or anything," said the single model. "But I have had a lot more friend requests on Facebook."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOnKanrKKkw6a%2B0qKYpWWkmrKvedaiq6FlpJ67unnWmqCsrF2stq%2B%2FjJqknqqZmK60ec2er61lpKS9brnOnZylZWJlfnF%2BkGs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

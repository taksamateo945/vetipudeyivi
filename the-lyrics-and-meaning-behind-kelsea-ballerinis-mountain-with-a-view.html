In a statement to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People Magazine</a>, Ballerini revealed why she decided to release Rolling Up the Welcome Mat.</p><p>“When I listen to&nbsp;SUBJECT TO CHANGE, I hear a lot of self-reflection and turmoil. This is the deep dive into that turmoil. I was writing by myself for most of the project, and it was nice to trust myself again,” the singer said.</p><p>She continued, “These are six songs I wish I had last year. It’s about the complexities of the feelings you go through during a massive shift at a young age. Rolling Up the Welcome Mat&nbsp;was how I processed everything. It’s the way I got my feelings out of my body and heart and put them to music — which is the purest way I could’ve handled it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOrZ%2BeZZyuv6qv0maYp5xdorKiusinnmaalZ22r7CMpJylq5WWeqOty6Wcq6GensBuuc6upa2ZmaN6uLXToWSaZaaesrh7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

The cast of beloved ’90s movie, D2: The Mighty Ducks, reunited Sunday, Sept. 21, <a href=#>for the film’s 20th anniversary</a>, which was documented by mainstay <strong>Marguerite Moreau</strong>.</p><p>The beloved childhood comedy released in 1994 told the story of coed kids’ hockey team coached by Gordon Bombay (<strong>Emilio Estevez</strong>). After an embarrassing loss against Team Iceland, Bombay’s Team USA regroups to win the Junior Goodwill Games against their rival country. The beloved sequel was considered to be even more successful than its predecessor, The Mighty Ducks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Moreau, who played Connie Moreau in the flick, attended the reunion with her husband <strong>Christopher Redman</strong>, who confirmed Sunday that a reunion was happening via Twitter. Redman shared numerous photos from the event, including the winning pic of attendees forming the venerable “Flying V” formation on a tennis court.</p><p>Moreau (who has since acted on Mad Men, Shameless, and Grey’s Anatomy) also posted pictures with her on-screen teammates and of course, her character’s love interest <strong>Garrett Henson</strong> (Guy Germaine). “Just saying…. #nofilter #connieandguy #mightyducks #20yearreunion,” she captioned the pic.</p><p>Photographed in a group hug at the reunion were <strong>Mike Vitar</strong> (Luis Mendoza), Henson, Moreau, <strong>Vincent Larusso </strong>(Adam Banks), <strong>Aaron Lohr </strong>(Dean Portman), and <strong>Scott Whyte</strong> (Gunnar Stahl). Interestingly enough (but not enough to deter him from attending the reunion!) Whyte played the enemy in D2 as the scary captain of Team Iceland.</p><p>California native Whyte gave an interview to hockey blog <a href=#>The Hockey Writers</a> last year, and said it amazes him that he still gets recognized frequently. “Honestly, I don’t know how people recognize it’s still me,” Whyte said. “It’s been 20 years! Here I am, older, much shorter hair, and every week Gunnar pops up at some point. To be recognized for something I did so long ago, I just embrace it. I always get a kick out of saying ‘you lost it for yourself’ to people that recognize me and see their reaction….priceless.”</p><p>Goldberg arrived! <a href=#>#mightyducks</a> reunion <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/vQlQReNOOm</a></p><p>— Christopher Redman (@iCHRISREDMAN) <a href=#>September 22, 2014</a></p><p>In the same interview, Whyte revealed that he’s still friendly with the cast. “I’m friends with Shaun Weiss [who played the beloved goalie Greg Goldberg], too,” he told the blog. “Every once in a while we reach out, say hi, see if we can come up with something funny to film and put out there, I think it’ll happen sometime.”</p><p>Weiss also attended the reunion on Sunday, and took a picture with his younger counterpart. “Boys grow up to be men #Goldberg #mightyducks #20yearreunion,” Moreau captioned the pic.</p><p>PHOTOS: ’90s actors — hotter then or now?</p><p>The girls of Quackdom! <a href=#>#mightyducks</a> reunion <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/jDqwVcwxLD</a></p><p>— Christopher Redman (@iCHRISREDMAN) <a href=#>September 22, 2014</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Noticeably missing from the reunion were some of the flick’s breakout stars: <strong><a href=#>Joshua Jackson</a></strong>, who played the team’s captain Charlie Conway, <strong>Kenan Thompson</strong>, D2‘s star player Russ Tyler, and Estevez, who led Team USA to victory.</p><p>Still, Jackson <a href=#>revealed to Time in an interview this past June</a> that the Mighty Ducks remained close to his heart. “I feel like a fourth film should happen, and if there was space for any of the original kids to come back and have a role, I would be surprised that anybody didn’t want to do it,” Jackson said. “The next generation should have its own version. Not that we need to come back as adults, but I hope my kids grow up and play pickup hockey and I hope that they have their own movies like my generation had those movies. In that way, yeah, of course, I’d be a part of something like that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOpqCgoKSueqXBwqSqZmpgqbVuvsSupaKnnmK9qq%2FTrqmeq12YrrTAjKucnKqVlsGmv4ytn55llqHGqrrGZq1mamBmgXN%2BmA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

The star has hired private <a href=#>security</a> as her bodyguard, who will protect her as she fears for her life.</p><p class=align-left>According to <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ZiMoja</a>, </i>the star hired the private security company shortly after she claimed last month that the South African Police Services (SAPS) are trigger-happy. A close source of the DJ said:</p>"It was unexpected to see her arrive at work with bodyguards. While we're aware of her family's taxi business, the presence of bodyguards caught us off guard. It seems a bit excessive; we highly doubt the police have any reason to target or harm her."<h2>Bheki Cele blames Zimdollar for murder of SIU officer</h2><p class=align-left>Speaking at Sthembiso Mazibuko's funeral, who was an SAPS National Intervention Unit officer, Minister <a href=#>Bheki Cele slammed Zimdollar</a> for alluding to officers as trigger-happy.</p><p class=align-left>He was referring to some of the comments she made during her radio show a few weeks back.

"But on the Internet it was like, ‘She’s annoyed they called her Kim Kardashian.' [I'm like,] 'No I’m not!'"</p><p>When asked where she'll keep the coveted award,<strong> North West</strong>'s mom said West isn't big on displaying their awards around their home.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Kanye’s not big on putting Grammys up and stuff like that. [His Grammys] were literally in the laundry room in a random sock drawer…so I’ve gathered them all and put them in a box in my room until we move, [but] maybe I can talk him into putting them in one of our offices or something. He’s just not into awards all over the house," she explained. "He’s not a show-off person."&nbsp;</p><p>Kardashian, on the other hand, said she'll place hers where she can see it! "I will put mine in the middle of my glam room. It’s so cool," she gushed.</p><p>After gushing that she loves being a wife, the 33-year-old went on to dish about her favorite food while in London. "Every time I come to London, I have an obsession with ribs. Like, last night we were rushing to get to Hakkasan after the awards and we just sat and ate so many ribs … It’s my favorite thing to do when I’m in London. And it’s low carb. I’m obsessed with ribs."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKipV2grrOwwKyfopmeYsGiuMqsZKCpXay8rq3NZqafZamarrN5wLCYq5xdnsBuu8GsnKyrlZl6uLXToWSroZKoenN8kG1qcg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

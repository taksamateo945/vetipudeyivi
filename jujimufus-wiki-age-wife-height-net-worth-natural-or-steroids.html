Natural or steroids?</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-04-14</div><p>• Jujimufu (Jon Call) is a weightlifter and acrobatics expert, best known for his appearances on America's Got Talent and his tricktutorials.com.<br>• He is married and has no children.<br>• He trains five times a week and follows a generic bodybuilder diet of 40:40:20 protein-carbohydrate-fat split.<br>• Jujimufu is 33 years old, 5ft 10in tall, and weighs 240lbs.<br>• He is active on social media and runs his own website for merchandise and training.</p>﻿ ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<h2><span id=Jujimufu_Wiki_Bio>Jujimufu Wiki Bio</span></h2><p>Jon Call was born in the USA on 9 December 1985 so under the zodiac sign of Sagittarius and holding American nationality – better known online as Jujimufu, he is popular for his career of a weight lifter.</p><h2><span id=Childhood_and_education>Childhood and education</span></h2><p>Jujimufu hasn’t talked much about his parents as he respects their privacy as much as his own, but he has shared that they have been very supportive of his career of a weight lifter – he hasn’t mentioned having any siblings, which is why he is considered to be an only child.</p><p>Jujimufu’s journey began at the age of 13 when his parents enrolled him in Taekwondo. Learning that he wasn’t in shape to be good enough at it, his parents paid a gym membership for him – the gym was right across the street from his school and he would go there every day after school to work out.</p><p>When he was 15, he learned about doing tricks, and found tutorials on the internet – he used his backyard as the place for his exercises, but soon learned that he wasn’t flexible enough for them. He began doing flexibility exercises every night for two hours, and it took him two months to obtain the flexibility he wanted.</p><p>After he matriculated from high school, Jujimufu enrolled at college and graduated four years later with a bachelor’s degree.</p><h2><span id=Career_of_a_bodybuilder_and_other_jobs>Career of a bodybuilder and other jobs</span></h2><p>Jujimufu’s career was officially launched in 2002, when he launched his tricktutorials.com website, using it to show people how to do tricks, and combine them with bodybuilding and other things.</p><p>He rose to prominence after he appeared in the 11th season of the “America’s Got Talent” show, but only passed to the second round. His well-built figure helped Jujimufu become a sought-after mode,l as he can often be seen in underwear commercials and advertisements, while he has also posed for numerous fitness magazines, and has worked with some of the most popular clothing and watch brands.</p><p>Jujimufu is a writer as well, and has so far released two books, entitled “Legendary Flexibility” and “Train 365”. He worked as a technical manager for a biotechnology group for more than seven years before deciding to leave the job in December 2016, and focus on his fitness career.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographypedia.org///biographypedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/61100865_442142829694578_4275537791990856618_n-859x1024.jpg></p><p>He and his friend Tom Boyden have since founded several businesses and social platforms, which are working better than expected. Jujimufu is a founder of acrobolix, which is a mixed technique combining acrobatic moves with bodybuilding.</p><p>Jujimufu launched his <a rel=nofollow href=#>YouTube channel</a> on 13 July 2008, in a collaboration with his friend Tom Boyden – there are currently more than 950,000 people subscribed to it, which also counts more than 150 million views of all their videos combined. They mostly upload funny videos related to exercising and weight lifting.</p><h2><span id=The_most_popular_male_bodybuilders_in_the_world>The most popular male bodybuilders in the world</span></h2><p><a rel=nofollow href=#>The Ranker website</a> has compiled a list of the most popular male bodybuilders in the world including those people who have made their way into other industries such as film and music. We are going to mention the top five male bodybuilders in the world chosen by the people’s votes:</p><ul><li>Fifth place is held by Mickey Hargitay who is an actor as well, and who became the Mr. Universe in 1955. He is popular for his appearances in “Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter”, “The Loves of Hercules”, and “Promises! Promises”;</li><li>Anthony White is in fourth place, who is better known under his ring name Tony Atlas – he is a bodybuilder, a powerlifter, and a professional wrestler. He holds the Mr. USA bodybuilding title, and is currently working with WWE;</li><li>In third place is <a rel=nofollow href=#>Bob Paris</a>, who is a writer, actor, public speaker, civil rights activist, and a bodybuilder – he became popular after winning the 1983 NPC American National and for becoming Mr. Universe after winning the IFBB World Bodybuilding Championship;</li><li>Second place goes to <a rel=nofollow href=#>Lou Ferrigno</a>, who is an actor, fitness trainer, and a bodybuilder – he has won IFBB Mr. America and IFBB Mr. Universe two times in a row, and is the star of the “Pumping Iron” documentary movie;</li><li>Top place is held by <a rel=nofollow href=#>Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, who is mostly popular for his acting career and his starring role in the “Terminator” movie franchise – he is also a model, producer, director, activist, businessman, investor, writer, politician and a philanthropist.</li></ul><p lang=en dir=ltr>67 and motivated everyday to remain strong, eat healthy and stay positive ??<br>IG| @theofficiallouferrigno <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/tNYTIpSP3l</a></p><p>— Lou Ferrigno (@LouFerrigno) <a rel=nofollow href=#>April 9, 2019</a></p><p>Even though Jujimufu is a well-built bodybuilder, he is nowhere to be found in the list of the most popular male bodybuilders in the world compiled by the Ranker website, yet.</p><h2><span id=Jujimufus_training_and_dieting>Jujimufu’s training and dieting</span></h2><p>Jujimufu has five training sessions every week which usually last between one and two hours – he used 2018 for an experiment as he worked out every day without any days off (straight 365 days).</p><p>When it comes to his exercises, he does all the moves he loves during his skill-work, however, when it is about bodybuilding exercises, he is mostly focused on those he isn’t good at, pectoral and biceps development due to genetics, so he works more on them than on other parts of his body.</p><p>The diet he follows is called a generic body builder diet – it includes six meals per day which are all high in protein. He eats a lot of carbohydrates, and is trying to reduce his intake of fat as much as he can – his daily protein-carbohydrate-fat split is 40:40:20. While other bodybuilders and fitness icons might recommend these foods, Jujimufu avoids oats, wheat, peanut butter and milk while he eats plenty of garlic, ginger root, lemons, rosemary, cinnamon, vegetables and fresh fruits.</p><h2><span id=Personal_life_and_relationships>Personal life and relationships</span></h2><p>Not much is known about Jujimufu’s love life, as he prefers to keep his personal matters to himself but he has allowed his fans to take a glimpse at a few details.</p><p>Jujimufu says on his webpage that he spends a lot of his free time with his wife. He hasn’t shared any information about her, but the two are rumored to have met at the gym in 2005, and begun dating shortly afterwards. They eventually exchanged their wedding vows in 2016, and although they have been together for more than 14 years now, they don’t have any kids, as they are both focused on their careers.</p><p>Jujimufu hasn’t commented about any other women he might have dated before his wife, and this is his first marriage – it is not known whether or not he and his wife are planning on having any kids in the future.</p><h2><span id=Hobbies_and_interests>Hobbies and interests</span></h2><p>Jujimufu spends most of his free time exercising at the gym, practicing tricks in his backyard, and being with his wife, but he has a couple of other interests as well.</p><p>Jujimufu uses his computer to organize his thoughts and everything he needs to do into text files. He goes around cleaning things in his house as he doesn’t enjoy sitting and doing nothing, and he will often walk aimlessly around his backyard, which he sees as a kind of meditation. He often goes out with his wife if both of them are free, and the craziest thing he has done for her was taking her on a sudden trip to another state, as he knew his wife was free for three days.</p><p>He is not much of a party person, and prefers to spend quality time in nature, or surrounded by friends and family rather than in overcrowded places.</p><h2><span id=Appearance_and_net_worth>Appearance and net worth</span></h2><p>Jujimufu is currently 33 years old. He has long brown hair and brown eyes, is 5ft 10ins (1.78m) tall, and weighs around 240lbs (109kgs).</p><p>According to authoritative sources, his current net worth is estimated to be more than $600,000, and is steadily rising thanks to several things he is currently working on.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographypedia.org///biographypedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/87079d7cab963a058b1db4cb78fae877-1024x576.jpg></p><h2><span id=Natural_or_Steroids>Natural or Steroids?</span></h2><p>Jujimufu does not use any steroids, but takes whatever supplements he believes he needs.</p><h2><span id=The_idea_behind_Jujimufu_nickname>The idea behind ‘Jujimufu’ nickname</span></h2><p>When he was around 14 years old and wanted to create a username for AOL messenger, all the names he wanted to use were already taken. He got mad and screamed Jujimufu – the nickname was not taken, and has been his main nickname for many years now.</p><h2><span id=Social_media_presence>Social media presence</span></h2><p>Jujimufu is very active on several popular social media platforms, as this is very important for the career he has built for himself on the internet.</p><p>He launched his Twitter account in August 2015 and is still followed by nearly 250 people, but has since deserted it as he focused on his accounts on other networks. His <a rel=nofollow href=#>Instagram account</a> is followed by more than 1.4 million people while he has uploaded nearly 800 pictures onto it – he is running a Facebook page as well, which counts more than 360,000 fans.</p><p>Jujimufu is running <a rel=nofollow href=#>his own website</a> on which you can buy his merchandise, read about his flexibility training, read his biography, and contact him in case you have any question or suggestions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCpnZSerm%2B70aBmo62anrq2stSsZLChm556orPEZq6inpVitaa1xqGrZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2amkanCs63LZqarZaOpsrO7yJ2qaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

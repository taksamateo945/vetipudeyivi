Spears didn't get much of a chance to show what he could do in a feature role given Henry's injury occurred in the fourth quarter of the Week 13 matchup, but he did finish the overtime contest with a season-high 16 carries for 75 yards and four receptions for 13 yards.</p><p>Spears, a third-round rookie out of Tulane, looks to be the heir to King Henry's throne. With the aging running back playing out the final year of his contract, Spears could be Tennessee's RB1 as early as next season. He's shown flashes of greatness in his limited usage this season, but hasn't seen enough volume to make a tangible impact in fantasy. That changed on Sunday when he posted a No. 14 finish and there's now a chance he will get to build on that.</p><p>Spears is a dynamic running back who can contribute as both a rusher and a pass-catcher. He should see heavy usage in both aspects of the game if Henry is not be able to go against the Miami Dolphins on Monday night. Tennessee has not been carrying a third-string running back on its active roster, and while a depth option like Julius Chestnut or Hassan Haskins would likely be activated, Spears figures to get the lion's share of backfield touches.</p><p>Adding Spears will likely only benefit managers for a single game, but he could be a difference-maker for rosters starved for running back talent. Keep an eye out for Henry updates and deploy him with confidence if the starter is ultimately sidelined.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaW6EdYWMn5inrJGoxm6yzqirm5mcoXq4scSkZGpsXayuqsLEq2SwoaKaeqbGxKSgnqRdmrmttc6tq2aZnpl6rrvRnmSfqpWaeqKzxKerZqiZmLi2vNI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

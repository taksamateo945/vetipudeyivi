&#34;I loved the idea of how all these guys always are stealing other guys’ girls and I was like, ‘There’s no female anthem for a girl stealing another guy's girl,' and that is the coolest thing ever,” the singer-songwriter tells Us Weekly."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Hayley Kiyoko Reveals Inspiration for Song</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-06-18</div><p>Girls like girls, like boys do! So says indie artist and Insidious: Chapter Three actress <strong>Hayley Kiyoko</strong>, who is giving a whole new meaning to female pop anthems with her latest single "Girls Like Girls” from her EP, This Side of Paradise.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>VIDEO: Ruby Rose Destroys Gender Roles, Transforms From Female Ideal to Male Ideal in Short Film "Break Free": Watch Now!</a></p><p>"I loved the idea of how all these guys always are stealing other guys’ girls and I was like, ‘There’s no female anthem for a girl stealing another guy's girl,' and that is the coolest thing ever,” the singer-songwriter tells <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>.</p><p>The former Disney star’s vision for the “Girls Like Girls” music video goes far beyond the cool factor. The video, which has already topped <a href=#>3.8 million views on Vevo</a> since its June 24 debut, sends a powerful message to young adults who might be struggling with sexual identity and self-acceptance, "It's become a universal video that brings out different kinds of emotions for different kinds of people,” she tells Us.</p><p>Starring Kiyoko’s Jem and the Holograms costar <strong>Stefanie Scott</strong> and actress <strong>Kelsey Chow</strong>, the video tells the story of a teenage girl who realizes that she has feelings for her female friend who has a boyfriend, and is forced to deal with certain emotional and physical adversities as she comes to terms with her feelings.</p><p>“I wanted the song to be the inner monologue that Coley [as played by Stefanie Scott] has where she wishes she was that confident, and those are the thoughts she had in her mind… I really wanted to create a video that kind of gave that a platform and gave girls some representation in a positive way during a time like that when you’re just so fragile and innocent in that self-discovery moment.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The songstress also directed the video alongside her friend Austin S. Winchell. She admits getting behind the camera didn’t come easy at first, "I definitely was nervous because I was like, ‘Well I hope I’m good! I hope this turns out okay!’” But those nerves were short-lived thanks to her unwavering commitment to her art, and even credits her mother, Sarah Kawahara, a major-league figure skater and choreographer, for passing along her natural ability to direct. “My mom choreographed the top Olympians, she’s really the queen of ice in her world so I kind of get my directorial bug from her because she’s really good at telling people what to do!” Kiyoko tells Us.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of inspiration, Kiyoko didn't have to search too far, having bonded on set with another Jem co-star and fellow female rocker <strong><a href=#>Juliette Lewis</a></strong>, who is the lead singer of her own band called Juliette Lewis & The Licks. According to Kiyoko, “[Juliette's] like the female Mick Jagger! She’s a big role model of mine, we’ve become close.”</p><p><a href=#>Juliette Lewis Sends Ex-Boyfriend Brad Pitt Birthday Wishes on Instagram</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJ6iqpyoeq21yp5koKGiocBuwM6oZKijXZ2uurjEsmSkoamkuLB50Z6tnpmcqHqqutKpoKuZpJ68r3nFqKlmq5%2BjtG5%2Bj2psa3Fn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

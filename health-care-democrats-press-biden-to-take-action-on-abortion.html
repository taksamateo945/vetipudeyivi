Wade.&nbsp;</p><p>Action from the president alone cannot reverse the slew of state bans going into effect after Friday’s ruling, but vocal Democrats say the urgency of the moment requires taking all action available to increase abortion access as much as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Sens.&nbsp;<strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong>&nbsp;(D-Mass.) and&nbsp;<strong>Patty Murray</strong>&nbsp;(D-Wash.) led a group of 23 Senate Democrats calling on Biden to explore a range of executive actions. Among their ideas:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Allowing abortions to be performed on federal property. &nbsp;</li><li>Providing vouchers for women to travel out of state to get an abortion.&nbsp;</li><li>The Congressional Black Caucus&nbsp;<a href=#>called on</a>&nbsp;Biden to declare a public health emergency around abortion to “utilize additional flexibilities and deploy resources where necessary.”&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>The question: How far is&nbsp;Biden comfortable going? </strong>The pressure is a test of how far Biden is willing to go on the issue as much of his party is outraged and demanding action.</p><p>The president, a Catholic, has sometimes had a complicated history on abortion, for example&nbsp;<a href=#>reversing</a>&nbsp;his support for the Hyde Amendment banning federal funding for abortion amid controversy in 2019 during the presidential primary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Read more here</a>.&nbsp;</p><a href=# class=thehill-promo-link__link rel=noopener><br>Abortion rights proponents file wave of lawsuits challenging bans</a><br><a href=# class=thehill-promo-link__link rel=noopener><br>Defense & National Security — US amps up weapons to Ukraine, Russia ups attacks</a><br><h2>Harris: No discussion about abortion on federal land</h2><p><strong>Vice President Harris</strong> downplayed one of the potential ideas for executive action on Monday, saying that the&nbsp;Biden&nbsp;administration is not discussing providing abortion services on federal lands in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling that struck down Roe v. Wade.&nbsp;</p><p>“I mean, it’s not right now what we are discussing,” Harris said in an interview with CNN’s&nbsp;Dana Bash&nbsp;on Monday when asked if using federal lands is an option.&nbsp;</p><p>Democrats, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Rep.&nbsp;Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&nbsp;(N.Y.), have called on the Biden administration to use federal land as places where people can receive abortions in states that restrict them.&nbsp;</p><p>Harris instead called on Americans to vote for Democrats.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s some debate among legal scholars that providing abortion services would violate the Hyde Amendment, though it’s not clear if that’s the case.&nbsp;</p><p>Dismissing the idea is likely to anger progressives and activists, who are growing impatient with what they view as a lack of a concrete action plan from the administration. &nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Read more here.</a>&nbsp;</p><a href=# class=thehill-promo-link__link rel=noopener><br>Abortion rights proponents file wave of lawsuits challenging bans</a><br><a href=# class=thehill-promo-link__link rel=noopener><br>Defense & National Security — US amps up weapons to Ukraine, Russia ups attacks</a><br><p><strong>OFFICIALS PRESS INSURERS ON FREE CONTRACEPTION COVERAGE&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Top&nbsp;Biden&nbsp;administration officials met with health insurance industry executives Monday to ensure that their plan members have access to contraceptive services at no cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Health and Human Services Secretary&nbsp;Xavier Becerra,&nbsp;Labor Secretary&nbsp;Marty Walsh&nbsp;and Treasury Secretary&nbsp;Janet Yellen&nbsp;met with major health insurance groups and plan sponsors to remind them of the legal obligation under ObamaCare to provide contraceptive coverage for free.&nbsp;</li><li>The meeting comes just days after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and left states to decide whether abortion is legal. In a concurring opinion, Justice&nbsp;Clarence Thomas&nbsp;called on the Supreme Court to reconsider its landmark 1965 case protecting access to contraceptives.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In all 50 states, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) guarantees coverage of women’s preventive services, including free birth control and contraceptive counseling, for individuals and covered dependents.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2020, the law provided 58 million women access to preventive services without cost sharing.&nbsp;</p><p>In a statement, the secretaries said they are concerned about complaints that some plans are not following the law and denying coverage in certain instances.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Read more here</a>. &nbsp;</p><a href=# class=thehill-promo-link__link rel=noopener><br>Abortion rights proponents file wave of lawsuits challenging bans</a><br><a href=# class=thehill-promo-link__link rel=noopener><br>Defense & National Security — US amps up weapons to Ukraine, Russia ups attacks</a><br><p><strong>JUDGE BLOCKS LOUISIANA TRIGGER LAW BANNING ABORTION&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A Louisiana judge blocked enforcement on Monday of statewide abortion ban designed to automatically go into effect when Roe fell.&nbsp;</p><p>Two abortion rights groups on Monday filed a challenge to Louisiana’s trigger law, which went into effect following the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization that struck down the federal right to abortion.&nbsp;</p><p>The Center for Reproductive Rights and Boies Schiller Flexner LLP requested emergency relief allowing providers in the state to continue providing abortions and patients to access the procedure.&nbsp;</p><p>In an email after the judge’s decision Monday, the&nbsp;Center for Reproductive Rights said, “Abortion care will resume in the state and a hearing has been set for July 8th.”&nbsp;</p><p>The groups, filing on behalf of organizations such as Hope Medical Group for Women and Medical Students for Choice, asked the court to review the state’s trigger laws and determine what options exist for lifesaving care that requires aborting a pregnancy.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Read more here</a>. &nbsp;</p><a href=# class=thehill-promo-link__link rel=noopener><br>Abortion rights proponents file wave of lawsuits challenging bans</a><br><a href=# class=thehill-promo-link__link rel=noopener><br>Defense & National Security — US amps up weapons to Ukraine, Russia ups attacks</a><br><h2>DC, NYC quickly max out on monkeypox vaccines</h2><p>New York City and Washington, D.C., both ran through their supplies of vaccines to treat monkeypox less than a day after launching their local immunization initiatives.&nbsp;</p><p>New York became the first major city in the U.S. to begin offering vaccines for monkeypox last week, making the two-dose Jynneos smallpox vaccine available to men who have sex with men as well as men who have had multiple sexual partners in the past 14 days.&nbsp;</p><p>The city gave no prior indication of its plans to start administering vaccines and the one clinic that was giving out doses was out of appointments on the same day it started booking them.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>On Monday, D.C. followed New York by announcing that it too would make rounds of Jynneos available to gay and bisexual men; transgender women and gender-nonconforming people; sex workers and people who work in high-risk situations.</li><li>D.C.

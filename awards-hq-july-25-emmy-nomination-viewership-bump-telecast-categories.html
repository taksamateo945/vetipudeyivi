When this year’s Emmy nominations were announced last week, the TV Academy decided not to tally up the contenders by network.<p>Sort of. The group still sent out a document listing all nominees by network as submitted but left the hard work of counting those noms, and deciding how to present that data, to others. This caused a lot of scrambling on nomination morning — and resulted in some early bad math — before it finally became clear that HBO, with or without HBO Max, had won this year’s derby over Netflix.</p><p>The decision to eliminate those network tallies has everything to do with the inter-network squabble over how they identify themselves. It’s all about ego and bragging rights, and after things got testy last year, the TV Academy decided to extract itself from the debate — and yes, turn the car around and head home.</p><p>The argument centers on whether HBO and HBO Max should combine their noms. Last year, it was only when the two combined that HBO beat out Netflix. This year, those concerns were moot, as HBO by itself was the leader, with 108 nominations versus 105 for Netflix. But combine HBO’s number with HBO Max’s 32, and suddenly that 140 total looks a lot more dominant.</p><p>So what’s the right way to go? If you, like me, think HBO and HBO Max will eventually be the same thing (as linear fades away), it probably, ultimately, won’t matter, and the outlet will simple be called “HBO,” “HBO Max” or even just “Max.”</p><p>But for now, HBO /HBO Max chief content officer&nbsp;<strong>Casey Bloys</strong>&nbsp;notes that it’s already one company under his oversight, so ultimately it should be combined as one number.</p><p>“I can’t think of another platform that has the same management, the same business affairs, the same production, same programming head,” he told me after the nominations were announced. “Everything on HBO airs on HBO Max.”</p><p>On the other hand, as Netflix would counter, HBO Max has a team under&nbsp;<strong>Sarah Aubrey</strong>&nbsp;that reports to Bloys, and it’s still accessed via very different platforms. The HBO shows are “HBO Originals,” and the HBO Max shows are deemed “Max Originals.” Hulu, ABC, Disney+, FX and Freeform all report to&nbsp;<strong>Dana Walden</strong>&nbsp;at Disney, but their respective nominations are counted toward their individual outlets.</p><p>Read more&nbsp;here.</p><p>********************************</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table class=x_stylingblock-content-wrapper role=presentation width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tbody readability=12.5><tr readability=25><td class=x_stylingblock-content-margin-cell><table class=x_stylingblock-content-wrapper role=presentation width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tbody readability=12.5><tr readability=25><td class="x_stylingblock-content-wrapper x_camarker-inner"><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tbody readability=12.5><tr readability=25><td><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tbody readability=12.5><tr readability=25><td class=x_responsive-td valign=top><table class=x_stylingblock-content-wrapper role=presentation width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tbody readability=2><tr readability=4><td class="x_stylingblock-content-wrapper x_camarker-inner"><h3>KCET Once Again Leads Local LA Emmys; KTLA, KVEA, KNBC Win Newscast Awards</h3></td></tr></tbody></table><table class=x_stylingblock-content-wrapper role=presentation width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tbody><tr><td class="x_stylingblock-content-wrapper x_camarker-inner"><table role=presentation width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tbody><tr><td align=center><img decoding=async alt width=600 data-imagetype=External src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image.email.variety.com/lib/fe9613727467027977/m/8/5a131064-1165-49f0-a816-b18871aa59fa.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table class=x_stylingblock-content-wrapper role=presentation width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tbody readability=11.5><tr readability=23><td class="x_stylingblock-content-wrapper x_camarker-inner" readability=50.5>Local public broadcaster KCET led all outlets at this year’s Los Angeles Area Emmy Awards, with six total, out of 15 nominations.

Here,&nbsp;Variety&nbsp;analyzes the competitive stakes in the key races.</p><p><strong>Drama Series</strong></p><p>With one&nbsp;more nominee than last year, this category is again a mixed bag. Early predictions were that it would be a battle between Netflix’s “Squid Game” and HBO’s “Succession.” At the SAG Awards, “Succession” took home the ensemble, but the Netflix series pulled out the acting wins. But they’re far from the only names in the game. Apple TV+’s “Severance” and Showtime’s “Yellowjackets” are two freshman shows in contention; the previous first-season show to win was “The Handmaid’s Tale” — proving that when a new show does take home the trophy, it has the&nbsp;ability to sweep&nbsp;. Plus, “Severance” earned writing, directing and casting noms, which bodes well. Of course, Netflix’s “Ozark” and AMC’s “Better Call Saul” are closing out their runs while the last-minute drop of “Stranger Things” may be in its favor, and HBO’s “Euphoria” has been a fan favorite all along</p><p><strong>Comedy Series</strong></p><p>One of my favorite stats to pull out is the fact that “Friends” didn’t win best comedy series until 2002 for Season 8; that year, the sitcom wasn’t nominated in the directing or writing categories, so don’t let the number of noms fool you. This year, ABC’s “Abbott Elementary” missed the directing nom, but&nbsp;creator and star&nbsp;<strong>Quinta Brunson</strong>&nbsp;still made history&nbsp;as the first Black woman to receive comedy nominations in the acting, writing and series categories. The sitcom is also one of few keeping broadcast television in the Emmy awards conversation. Elsewhere, HBO’s “Barry” brings the darker element to the category while Hulu’s “Only Murders in the Building” and “Hacks” tied with a whopping 17 nominations each. And don’t forget about last season’s winner, Apple TV+’s “Ted Lasso,” which led the race with 20 nominations. HBO’s “Curb Your Enthusiasm” isn’t in the zeitgeist as much, but still landed a nom for nine of its 10 years, while FX’s “What We Do in the Shadows” proved it’s not a sleeper either with seven noms. Amazon Prime Video’s “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” took home the trophy for its first season and this could be the comeback tour.</p><p><strong>Limited/Anthology Series</strong></p><p>With three of the five nominations this year, Hulu is leading the limited space — and could surely pull out the win. With “Dopesick” and “The Dropout” likely to take home acting prizes as well, both series are popular with the Academy. “Pam & Tommy” was a bit of a wild card but with 10 noms, it’s clear that the pop culture-heavy show was a hit with voters. Outside of Hulu, Netflix’s “Inventing Anna” made a splash as one of the first series Shonda Rhimes created within her Netflix deal, as did HBO’s “The White Lotus,” which remains in the limited category,&nbsp;despite being in production on Season 2. (While it will take place at a new resort, supporting nominee&nbsp;<strong>Jennifer Coolidge&nbsp;</strong>is returning.) Plus, the show racked up 20 noms so don’t count it out from any category.</p><p><strong>Variety Talk Series</strong></p><p>It’s hard to imagine a world in which “Last Week Tonight With&nbsp;<strong>John Oliver</strong>” doesn’t take the win in this category, mostly because it has for the past six years. This year, the show earned five noms overall and HBO/HBO Max&nbsp;remains the most nominated of all, so it seems likely. That said, with “Conan” out of the mix, “Late Night With&nbsp;<strong>Seth Meyers</strong>” broke in — the perfect time with this timely takes on the COVID-19 pandemic and the up and down political landscape. On the ballot again this year is “<strong>Jimmy Kimmel&nbsp;</strong>Live!” Despite consistently earning recognition on noms day, the show’s never taken home a Primetime Emmy. But he is more in the conversation than ever, thanks to the popularity of “Live in Front of a Studio Audience,” which earned two noms this year.</p><p><strong>Competition Program</strong></p><p>In the unscripted series, it’s hard to make a change. Since VH1’s “<strong>RuPaul</strong>’s Drag Race” broke into the category in 2018, and has won for four consecutive years. This time, the flagship earned eight noms and its three spinoffs snagged one nom each. Past winners are also in the category: CBS’ “The Amazing Race,” a 10-time winner, has two noms, while NBC’s “The Voice” (three overall noms) has been nominated every year since 2012 and has won four times. Netflix’s “Nailed It!” (two noms) and Bravo’s “Top Chef ” (five noms for the flagship and one for its spinoff) are back. The one to watch is newcomer “<strong>Lizzo&nbsp;</strong>’s Watch Out for the Big Grrrls” from Prime Video with six noms. Just as “Drag Race” did, this one could make quite the splash, especially if the Academy is looking to evolve.</p><p>Read more&nbsp;here.</p><p>********************************</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table class=x_stylingblock-content-wrapper role=presentation width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tbody readability=30><tr readability=60><td class=x_stylingblock-content-margin-cell><table class=x_stylingblock-content-wrapper role=presentation width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tbody readability=30><tr readability=60><td class="x_stylingblock-content-wrapper x_camarker-inner"><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tbody readability=30><tr readability=60><td><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tbody readability=30><tr readability=60><td class=x_responsive-td valign=top><table class=x_stylingblock-content-wrapper role=presentation width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tbody readability=1.5><tr readability=3><td class="x_stylingblock-content-wrapper x_camarker-inner"><h3>ON THE CIRCUIT: ‘Ted Lasso’ Celebration, Comic-Con Activations and More</h3></td></tr></tbody></table><table class=x_stylingblock-content-wrapper role=presentation width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tbody><tr><td class="x_stylingblock-content-wrapper x_camarker-inner"><table role=presentation width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tbody><tr><td align=center><img decoding=async alt width=600 data-imagetype=External src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image.email.variety.com/lib/fe9613727467027977/m/8/12763761-c3f5-4cac-864d-108df4bd210e.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table class=x_stylingblock-content-wrapper role=presentation width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tbody readability=29.5><tr readability=59><td class="x_stylingblock-content-wrapper x_camarker-inner" readability=72.5>Apple TV+ held a Los Angeles screening and tailgate event celebrating the massive Emmy haul for “Ted Lasso,” and featuring stars&nbsp;<strong>Hannah Waddingham, Brett Goldstein, Juno Temple, Jeremy Swift, Phil Dunster, Sarah Niles, Toheeb Jimoh, Cristo Fernández, Kola Bokinni, James Lance</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Sam Richardson</strong>.

Paydays for actors of $1 million an episode or more — once a rare occurrence, with the exception of long-running comedy megahits like “Friends” and “The Big Bang Theory” — are now commonplace for A-list talent, especially movie stars diving into the marathon of episodic television production.<p>But for everyone else? According to multiple TV talent agents who spoke with&nbsp;Variety, the second tier of players aren’t commanding the same exorbitant fees that they might have fetched a few years ago, at the height of the streaming boom.</p><p>“It’s taken a little bit of a hit,” says one insider. “There’s a much deeper and steeper sliding scale between No. 1 or 2 on the call sheet and 3, 4 and 5. I think that had to do a lot with the oversaturation of salaries on shows. I think a lot of places are realizing that you can pay the one big star, but you can’t pay seven of them.”</p><p>That $1 million-per-episode figure remains the magic number for top TV talent. With the days of seemingly unlimited spending on streaming shows going the way of the dodo as companies like Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery look to trim their expenses, many are trying to cap salaries at that mark.</p><p>With fears of an economic downturn, and a bit of a question about the health of the streaming world, there’s an overall sense that budgets are about to be scrutinized even more.</p><p>According to talent reps, the top range of TV salaries has leveled off at $750,000 to $1 million per episode for the key player, with the next tier ranging between $600,000 and $800,000.</p><p>Granted, star paychecks can go above that with bonuses and producing fees added in. Sources also note that streamers might be willing to pay more for an exceptionally well-known A-lister making a first foray into television, but those are indeed a select few nowadays. (All bets are off, of course, if someone like&nbsp;<strong>Tom Cruise</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Denzel Washington</strong>&nbsp;wants to do a series.)</p><p>“Platforms appear to be trying to keep episodic fees under $1 million, with that number being reserved for only the biggest names,” one rep says.</p><p>Recent examples include&nbsp;<strong>Will Ferrell</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Paul Rudd</strong>&nbsp;for “The Shrink Next Door” at Apple TV+ and&nbsp;<strong>Michael Keaton</strong>&nbsp;on Hulu’s “Dopesick.” Then there’s the&nbsp;<strong>Taylor Sheridan</strong>&nbsp;universe, where icons like&nbsp;<strong>Kevin Costner</strong>&nbsp;(“Yellowstone”),&nbsp;<strong>Harrison Ford&nbsp;</strong>(“1923”),&nbsp;<strong>Helen Mirren</strong>&nbsp;(“1923”) and&nbsp;<strong>Sylvester Stallone</strong>&nbsp;(“Tulsa King”) are all believed to be receiving handsome paychecks.</p><p>In the case of “1923” and “Tulsa King,” of course, it’s part of Paramount Global’s investment in turning Paramount+ into a must-have streaming brand. The other recent streamer upstart, Peacock, is shelling out decent-sized salaries (although perhaps not quite like those) for stars like&nbsp;<strong>Pete Davidson</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Natasha Lyonne</strong>.</p><p>Read the full story, and a sample of some of this year’s major TV salaries,&nbsp;here.</p><p>********************************</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table class=x_stylingblock-content-wrapper role=presentation width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tbody readability=9.5><tr readability=19><td class=x_stylingblock-content-margin-cell><table class=x_stylingblock-content-wrapper role=presentation width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tbody readability=9.5><tr readability=19><td class="x_stylingblock-content-wrapper x_camarker-inner"><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tbody readability=9.5><tr readability=19><td><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tbody readability=9.5><tr readability=19><td class=x_responsive-td valign=top><table class=x_stylingblock-content-wrapper role=presentation width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tbody readability=2><tr readability=4><td class="x_stylingblock-content-wrapper x_camarker-inner"><h3>AWARDS CIRCUIT PODCAST: Will ‘Ted Lasso’ End With Season 3?

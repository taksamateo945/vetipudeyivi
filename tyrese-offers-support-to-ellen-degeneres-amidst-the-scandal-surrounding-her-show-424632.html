This too shall passâ€¦.. Iâ€™ve learned over the years that when things get uncomfortable itâ€™s because GOD is preparing you for the NEW SEASON of your lifeâ€¦. He wants disloyal people to REVEAL THEMSELVESâ€¦. He wants people who have gone above and beyond for over the YEARS who have no integrity to reveal themselvesâ€¦ Ellen was JUST honored and praised for giving and giving and giving [ cause this is what she does constantly on her show and in real life ] and now this? Ellen if you see this messageâ€¦.. You are a GEM of a woman and wifeâ€¦.. I am not one of the lucky ones who have hung with you 40 to 50 times over the yearsâ€¦ But I know a kind-hearted and giving person when I see one and you fit the bill.â€™</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CDgxNu8hYLw/</p><p>He concluded by saying: â€˜Iâ€™m just speaking facts about Ellen based on my own personal experiences and more importantly how I feel about her in generalâ€¦â€¦.

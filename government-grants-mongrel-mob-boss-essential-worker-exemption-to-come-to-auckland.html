Newstalk ZB can reveal the exemption was granted to Sonny Fatupaito – who’s been working with some of the harder to reach communities in the city, such as those with gang affiliations."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This was approved as an essential worker exemption”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/NB3u2QJi438M4DRubhCAw5-Iexc=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/AFBP2QCDUR4VOUT77WGW5JDRRA.jpg"><p>The spokesman said it’s important our response is adaptable to recognise the needs and context of people impacted by Covid-19.</p><p>“The work done by the individuals assisting Auckland Regional Public Health Service includes engaging with the community about isolation requirements for positive cases and close contacts, encouraging testing for Covid-19 and helping facilitate welfare support.”</p><p>Covid Response Minister Chris Hipkins said it is important that everyone has trust in the public health response to Covid-19.</p><p>“I back any method that will help us to reach those who are hard to reach, and back the Ministry of Health and police to make the right decisions about how we do that,” he said.</p><p>“We need people to get tested for Covid-19 without fear of being prosecuted, and we need people to go into isolation and quarantine to keep the community safe. We also need people to be vaccinated to further protect the community from Covid-19.”</p><p>Fatupaito, through a spokesperson, said the high level of risk is “far from over and the Mongrel Mob Kingdom will be facilitating further educational health programmes in the Waikato”.</p><p>That event aims to target those who are vaccine-hesitant, providing them with support and strategies to get vaccinated.</p><p>“The consequence of failure is something many other countries have seen, hopefully NZ will continue to enjoy the benefits that isolation and strict contact protocols have brought.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnl6TDpr7NppynrF2cv6K606xkpqeenL%2BmuIympptlkqTAtHnErKqepqSerq151qippJ2iYrK5scypq6KnnmLBsHnCqKSeZaSkeqLBwqSjmqaUZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

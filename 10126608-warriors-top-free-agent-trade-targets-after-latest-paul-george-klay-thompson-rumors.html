George declined his $48.7 million player option with the Los Angeles Clippers Saturday and he's now set to hit free agency, per ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. Golden State likely could have made a push for George in the trade market, but he'll now likely be unaffordable in free agency.
Golden State is also reportedly planning on a future without Klay Thompson, per The Athletic's Shams Charania and Anthony Slater, meaning a new shooting option next to Steph Curry will likely need to come through free agency or a trade this offseason."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Golden State likely could have made a push for George in the trade market, but he'll now likely be unaffordable in free agency.</p><p>Golden State is also reportedly planning on a future without Klay Thompson, per The Athletic's <a href=# rel=noopener>Shams Charania and Anthony Slater</a>, meaning a new shooting option next to Steph Curry will likely need to come through free agency or a trade this offseason.</p><p>After George opted out of his contract, here are a few potential free agent and trade targets for the Dubs.</p><p><b>Trade Targets</b></p><ul class="atom bulletedList"><li>Kevin Durant</li><li>Brandon Ingram</li><li>Bogdan Bogdanović</li></ul><p><b>Free Agents</b></p><ul class="atom bulletedList"><li>Derrick Jones Jr.</li><li>Eric Gordon</li><li>Buddy Hield&nbsp;</li></ul><p><b>Trade Targets</b></p><p>Could the Dubs make the ultimate splash this offseason and bring back Durant? It would be a bit of a stretch, but would give the Warriors a chance to add another title before Curry retires.</p><p>After the way last season ended, it wouldn't be all that surprising if Durant wants to move on from the Suns—especially considering how easily he has jumped ship in the past. Golden State could offer Phoenix a player like Andrew Wiggins along with a handful of future draft picks to help it prepare for the rebuild that seems to be coming.</p><p>Of course, sending picks away would hurt the Warriors in the long run as they prepare for the post-Curry years.</p><p>Ingram is a more realistic option for Golden State this offseason. While he doesn't have the scoring abilities of Durant, he can use his size to get to the basket while also providing decent numbers from beyond the arch.</p><p>Bogdanović has made the most of his time in the NBA, emerging as a reliable catch-and-shoot option with a career average of 38.4 percent from deep. With Thompson likely on his way out, Bogdanović would help the Warriors retain some of their identity and remain one of the best three-point shooting teams in the league.</p><p><b>Free Agent Options</b></p><p>Jones is coming off a successful debut season with the Dallas Mavericks, where he averaged 8.6 points, 3.3 rebounds and an assist per game while playing 23.5 minutes per game. He spent most of his time as a starter in Dallas, but he could be a solid option off the bench for a somewhat lower price tag.</p><p>Gordon, a veteran three-point specialist who spent last season with the Phoenix Suns, could help ease the burden of losing Thompson. While he's less of a scoring threat than Thompson, he could at least give Golden State another shooter to look to on the wing.</p><p>Gordon is a career 37.1 percent three-point shooter and had similar numbers last season. Furthermore, the 16-year veteran is still seeking his first title, so he could be willing to join the team at a reasonable price point if it gets him closer to winning a championship.</p><p>Hield could offer a similar role as Gordon, but would likely give the Warriors a few more seasons at just 31 years old. Considering his age, Hield would likely command a higher price tag.</p><p>The eighth-year veteran had a lesser role with the Philadelphia 76ers after he was traded from the Indiana Pacers, and joining the Warriors could offer him a chance to return to the starting lineup.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmuDcYSMsJirqpmkv7R506inZp6imrJurcaepa1lpKeupbGMrZirn5WpwG6txa2cq2WclsGmv9Nmp5qtnGK0prvRoJxmo5yWxm7Ax6ikqaufo3qzwcyoqaw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

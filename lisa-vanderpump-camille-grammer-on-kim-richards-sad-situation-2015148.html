Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star <strong>Lisa Vanderpump</strong> and former cast member <strong>Camille Grammer </strong>opened up to Us Weekly and other reporters on Thursday, Aug. 13, about <strong>Kim Richards</strong>, who was <a href=#>recently hospitalized amid ongoing struggles</a> with sobriety.</p><p>“Well, I’m sorry Kim’s not here because of the situation,” Vanderpump told <strong>Us</strong> at her Hero Dog Awards Benefit Luncheon, which was held at her West Hollywood restaurant PUMP. “That’s the thing. But I think her sobriety is more important than any reality show. And I think a lot of people recognize that fact and that’s probably why she’s not in this season.”</p><p>The Vanderpump Rules star told <strong>Us</strong> that she last reached out to Richards during her stint in rehab earlier this summer. “But not since then,” she noted. “I’m not that close to Kim, obviously I’m closer to Kyle. I’ve heard updates and stuff. But it’s a sad situation.”</p><p>Richards, 50, <a href=#>was arrested this past April</a> on charges of public intoxication, battery, and resisting arrest, after she caused a scene at the Beverly Hilton. She then checked into rehab. Last month, she celebrated her first 30 days of sobriety in an interview with Entertainment Tonight.</p><p>“I went in and I got to learn a whole lot about myself,” Richards told ET of treatment. “I dug deep into my past, things that happened to me as a child, good and bad, teenage years, relationships with all my loved ones, where they need to be mended, where they’re very powerful. I worked on me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Less than two weeks after that interview, on Aug. 2, the former child star was arrested when she was caught shoplifting from a Target store in California’s San Fernando Valley. According to police, Richards was suspected of walking out of the retailer with nearly 100-plus items worth nearly $600 total.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Like Vanderpump, Grammer hasn’t spoken to the troubled reality star recently. “I was on vacation in Hawaii. But I will reach out to her soon,” the veteran RHOBH star told <strong>Us</strong>. “I mean, I feel bad for Kim. My thoughts and prayers are with her and I support her and I just want her to know I’m here for her if she needs anything.”</p><p>Both ladies also chimed in on Brandi Glanville’s very obvious absence from the event. It was confirmed by Us Weekly in June that neither Richards nor Glanville would be returning to Bravo’s smash franchise for the upcoming Season 6.</p><p>“Brandi, listen, I have no problem with her,” Vanderpump told <strong>Us</strong>. “I don’t even really think about her much. I just hope she’s… I would’ve invited her today, actually, because it’s a dog event. We bonded over dogs but [um… I would have. But] …I forgot.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKOiq5Fiw6K6w56pqa2dpXqkrcyio6WdXZy%2FornMnqlmp55iuKq5jKugnKCRp7G0edKam2armanCosDIqKVmamBmgnKAlw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

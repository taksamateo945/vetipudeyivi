Today, Goldberg revealed she was fighting for her life because of pneumonia.

I am here,” before going on to say that she has been up and moving around, but is still healing from her illness. “I’m not dead,” the star joked. According to Whoopi, she almost died as a consequence of pneumonia.</p><p>Goldberg said on the show that surprisingly, even people who don’t like her very much have been saying nice things about her. The EGOT winner added that she was thrilled at the idea of seeing her castmates soon.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>.<a href=# rel=nofollow>@WhoopiGoldberg</a> shares an update on her health as she recovers from pneumonia, saying she’s “okay” and “up and moving around”: “I came very, very close to leaving the Earth. Good news, I didn’t. Thank you for all of your good wishes.” <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/f8u2wbJuik</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/KfBR05dL1t</a></p><p>— The View (@TheView) <a href=# rel=nofollow>March 8, 2019</a></p><p>Back in the final days of February, Joy Behar stated Whoopi was recovering from pneumonia because a lot of people online thought she’d be hosting the Oscars this year. Obviously, Whoopi wasn’t the host, in fact, no one was. The ceremony went hostless this year.</p><p>As it was previously reported, Kevin Hart was supposed to host the Oscars but had to back out at the last minute because his old tweets from a decade ago were outed as homophobic and the Academy asked him to apologize.</p><p>Kevin, rather than placating to the Academy, said that he refused to host the Oscars because he didn’t want to apologize for tweets he had already addressed at one time in his life. Kevin tweeted back in the late 2000s that he didn’t want his son to become a gay man.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The Academy apparently approached Chris Rock as well, but the comedian said Americans had become too sensitive in recent years. However, as some have noted online, most people aren’t too sensitive, it’s just that companies and organizations are bowing down to a very small – but very vocal – minority.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGennbywvMhmnqiklJeys7OMq5yvnZGhwG6%2Fx55kmqSdpMC1ec%2BaqqydlGKuuK3YZq6hoZyaeqe1xqGroqaXYr2vsdSmpqehkWJ%2FdoCUb2ho</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

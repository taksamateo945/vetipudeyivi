Executive Vice President of Original Programming & Development at E!, Jeff Olde, said, “Very few love stories have created as much pop culture buzz as Rob and Chyna’s, and we are thrilled to see Rob in such a happy place. We are excited to share the next chapter in their relationship.”</p><p>‘Rob & Chyna’ will be produced by&nbsp;Ryan Seacrest Productions and Bunim/Murray Productions just like ‘Keeping Up with the Kardashians’.

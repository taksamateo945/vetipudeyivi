The win was considered a major upset, giving Haney the first loss of his professional career. The result has been overturned and will be a no-contest on both fighters' records.</p><p>"I want to thank the commission and the fans who stood by me during this whole process," Haney told Coppinger. "The facts are the facts, and I wasn't on an even playing field. Happy I was able to receive justice for what happened. It's all part of my story and it's only going to make me better. I look to enjoy this time with my family and friends and see what's next.</p><p>"I'm a clean athlete and boxing is a brutal sport where one fight can literally change your life. I think it important for fighters to be clean and I want to become an advocate for clean athletes for my experience in this situation."</p><p>Garcia has vehemently denied purposefully taking performance-enhancing drugs. His representatives released a statement saying the fight will "never be erased" despite being wiped from the record books.</p><p>"Ryan, with his legal team, has resolved this issue and firmly maintains his truth: he never intentionally took any banned substance," Team Garcia said in a statement provided to ESPN. "It's simply not in his nature. ... The fans will always remember his performance against Haney as a masterclass, and that will never be erased."</p><p>Haney remains the WBC junior welterweight champion, along with holding the WBA (Super), WBC, IBF, WBO, and <i>The Ring</i> lightweight titles. He has not announced his next fight.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmqCeH2Mq7Capl2crrOvyJqqZqqVnru0wMCtnKadnql6pa3TnmSappRiv7a4xKxkq52mmq6tscNmmJ%2Bslad6tMHSqZynq5mku26y0aikZqCRo7K6ecWinqGs</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

In the spring issue of <a href=#>V Man </a>magazine, Hoult opens up about his relationship with Lawrence, and what he thinks makes her special.</p><p>"The privacy thing obviously changes but the rest pretty much stays the same," Hoult, 24, explained in the magazine (via <a href=#>Huffington Post</a>) of Lawrence's success.</p><p>Lawrence has earned Oscar nods for her roles in 2010's Winter's Bone, 2012's Silver Linings Playing (which she won), and 2013's American Hustle. She's also become a blockbuster superstar by taking on the lead role of Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games franchise.</p><p>Hoult, who accompanied Lawrence to the 2014 Oscars on March 2, believes that his girlfriend hasn't let the fame change her. "It's like that thing whereby you don't believe your own hype. Enjoy the good times, but don't get swept away with it," the English actor explained. "I think that's something she's capable of doing, and that's what makes her special, but yeah, it is very odd, and I am just kind of a bystander in many ways. It is well-deserved for her. I haven't really seen any change in her."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hoult himself has been acting since the age of 7, and broke out when he starred alongside <a href=#><strong>Hugh Grant</strong></a> in 2002's About a Boy. He and Lawrence began dating in 2011 after filming X-Men: First Class, but split in January 2013. Shortly after, however, the two <a href=#>rekindled their romance</a> while reprising their roles as mutants Mystique and Beast in the upcoming X-Men: Days of Future Past.</p><p>Working together has only helped their relationship. "It's fun because in this business you are away from one another for long periods of time, so when you're on set together it's a brilliant thing, because you actually get to spend time together," Hoult told V Man. "Especially with this film, I got to spend time with her."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKWim5ikuaK%2FjKGmrqSkYremus2inZ6qXaGuuL7Ep5qeZaedrrV5zJqinqtdnbKzedKpnJyhkaF6c3yQbW5s</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

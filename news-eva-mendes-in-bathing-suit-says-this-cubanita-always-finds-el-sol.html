She says that she makes sure to eat healthy. Mendes also says that she makes sure to get enough protein, especially in the mornings for breakfast. "I mostly keep it simple and have scrambled eggs and a piece of Ezekiel toast," she said. "I find that when I start out with the right source of protein, it definitely helps."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/GettyImages-1032961994.jpg><p><span>When it comes to her diet, Mendes isn't about variety. She tells Shape that she mostly eats the same healthy options each day. "I'm a creature of habit that way," she said. "I don't get bored with food. I try to think about it as fuel for my body." Mendes cites salmon with rice or quinoa as a go-to for her.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/GettyImages-654240140.jpg><p><span>Mendes makes sure to workout. She shared with Shape that she likes to run, and that she does different types of running exercises. "I love doing intervals," Mendes says. "Like running and sprinting, and I see great results with that versus the 30 to 45 minutes of steady cardio I used to do on the treadmill." Running is a cardio, aerobic, and endurance exercise.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/GettyImages-847219478.jpg><p><span>Mendes eats healthy, however, she also isn't afraid of indulging. She tells </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Shape</span></a><span> that one of the things that motivates her to stay healthy is her love of indulging. "Sweets are my thing," she reveals. "The kid in me thinks, I work out, so I can support my sugar habit. I know that's not a very wise thing to say, but I really do feel like I'm working it off!"</span></p><p><span>Mendes has amazing skin. However, she tells </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Byrdie</span></a><span> that her skincare isn't super complicated. "I can't do the many-step process type of routine," she says. "I just can't. I want to say it's motherhood, but even before, I'm just too high energy. I don't have the time; I don't have the patience for it. So, it's like, 'Please give me three products and that's it.' [Laughs] I'm true to my products until my face or my body or my hair tells me it's time to change."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxknq6RYrqmusOeqmahnmKvosDHoqWgZaOqtrV50pqwrGWknba0ecKumZqmmamubq3LsJiyq12btq%2Bw0macpWWjpLlw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

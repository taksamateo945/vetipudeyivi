Hosea Williams, American civil rights leader and politician (born Jan. 5, 1926, Attapulgus, Ga.—died Nov. 16, 2000, Atlanta, Ga.), was a significant figure in the struggle against segregation and served with the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., as an organizer and advanced man. He helped lead such demonstrations as the “Bloody Sunday” march in Selma, Ala., in 1965, during which marchers seeking voting rights for African Americans were tear-gassed and brutally beaten, and he was present when King was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn., in 1968.#hoseawilliams#blackhistorymonth#blackisbeautiful #Rp @osterling11,’ Porsha captioned her post.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B8MaIT9nhKT/</p><p>People are praising the man, and they also tell Porsha that she is twinning with her daughter PJ.

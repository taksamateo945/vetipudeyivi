middle of June<br>Midnight thunderstorm<br>There was something in the headlights<br>It stopped me on a dime<br>Well, she was scared to death<br>So I said “Climb in” and in she climbed<br>Oh, yeah</p><p>Well, she was bruised and broke from head to toe<br>With a tear in her blood stained shirt<br>She didn’t tell the whole truth but she didn’t have to<br>I knew what had happened to her<br>I didn’t load her down with questions<br>That girl had been through enough<br>I just threw it in drive, looked in those eyes<br>And I asked her where he was</p><p>I don’t know if he’s an angel<br>‘Cause angels don’t do what he did<br>He was hellbent to find the man behind<br>All the whiskey scars I hid<br>I never thought my day of justice<br>Would come from a judge under a seat<br>But I knew right then I’d never get hit again<br>When he said to me</p><p>“Wait in the truck”<br>“Just wait in the truck”</p><p>Well, I knocked and knocked and no one came<br>So I kicked in his double wide door<br>I let the hammer drop before he got<br>To that 12 he was reaching for<br>I didn’t try to hide my pistol<br>I didn’t even try to run<br>I just sat on the porch, smoking one of his cigarettes<br>And waited for the cops to come</p><p>I don’t know if he’s an angel<br>‘Cause angels don’t do what he did<br>He was hellbent to find the man behind<br>All the whiskey scars I hid<br>I never thought my day

mercy on me, Lord<br>Have mercy on me<br>Have mercy on me (oh), Lord</p><p>It’s been sixty months and she still comes<br>To see me from time to time<br>It was worth the price, to see a brighter side<br>Of the girl I picked up that night<br>And I might be here forever<br>It ain’t paradise that’s true<br>But it’s a whole hell of a lot better<br>Than the place I sent him to, yeah</p><p>(Have

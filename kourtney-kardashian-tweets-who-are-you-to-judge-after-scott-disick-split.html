But who are you to judge your neighbor? James 4:12,” Kardashian tweeted on Saturday.</p><p>Besides lashing out at those who have been judging the split, the mother of three seems to be enjoying time away from Disick by hanging out with her sisters, Kim and Khloe Kardashian. She was seen stepping out with her two sisters for dinner looking very confident, rocking a crop top and white netted skirt.</p><p>Kourtney has also been bonding with Kim and Khloe, posting a photo on her Instagram of the three working out this past Tuesday.</p><p>As for Disick, a source from Perez Hilton claimed that he canceled his club appearance in Las Vegas because it was too far now that he is spending time in New York. However, he isn’t over the club scene yet, as he apparently is scheduled to make an appearance for next Saturday in Atlantic City, New Jersey.</p><p>Sources also revealed that Disick might get the axe from appearing on “Keeping Up With The Kardashians.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kuLDB0a2lnrFdoK6zsMCsn6KZnmLBuLHErapmr5ikeqK%2BxGawqK1dqbxuttSdnp5lkZvBpr6MrJqorKRisaq%2FyJyiZqugoba1ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Normally the Golden Buzzer is pressed afterwards. He gave you the Golden Buzzer, and you performed in the confetti. It was wonderful,” Cowell said.<p class=align-left>See the video below:</p><p class=align-left>Netizens showered the energetic performers with praise, and below are some of their comments on the post:</p><p class=align-left>@DeVeda Ayoka Zauditu wrote:</p>"I smiled through this whole video!!!

Thanks, Bruno - that was ￼the coolest thing I’ve ever seen you do, and they definitely deserved it."<p class=align-left>@Zarah Hall wrote:</p>"That's the way to do the golden buzzer, brilliant."<p class=align-left>@Charles Elo Ezeh wrote:</p>"This is so amazing. I could literally jump out of my seat celebrating with them. When it's your time, nothing on earth can stop it. Just keep sharpening your skills, develop that inert potential, and one day it will find the expression where you least expected it.

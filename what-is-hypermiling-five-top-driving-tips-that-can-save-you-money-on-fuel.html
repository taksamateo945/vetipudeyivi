Fuel and transport costs are still proving to be one of the biggest challenges many consumers face.</p><p>The RAC fuel price tracker reveals that, as of March 31, both unleaded and diesel prices had shot up from the previous months considerably. This means that plenty of motorists are looking to save money where they can.</p><p>While some owners have been using the current fuel price increase as an excuse to move to an electric vehicle, not everyone can afford to make that switch. Many people are hanging on to their current car and have instead been looking at ‘hypermiling’ techniques to cut back on fuel costs.</p><p><b>Read more:</b>This Yorkshire county is the cheapest place to buy petrol in England right now</p><h3><b>What is hypermiling?</b></h3><p>According to Autoexpress, hypermiling was a term first used in the USA during the high fuel prices of the early 2000s. It refers to drivers who take great strides to reduce their fuel use.</p><p>For many, hypermiling will begin with the decision of whether to drive at all. If the journey is a relatively short one and it is possible to walk or cycle, most hypermilers will opt to do just that. Or maybe public transport would be a better option in other cases. However, when it comes to a journey that really must be made in a vehicle, hypermiling involves the following techniques:</p><h4><b>1. Plan the most direct route in advance</b></h4><p>Many motorists may be surprised to learn that they may not be taking the most efficient route on some of the journeys they are regularly making. Often, with a routine trip we’ve been making for a long time, we pick a route we know and then stick with it.</p><p>However, it’s worth checking if a better route exists. If this is a journey you often make, such as a trip to work, finding even a slightly shorter journey can make a big difference to your annual fuel bill.</p><p>Similarly, spending a bit of time looking up your route in advance can help save you money and fuel for longer journeys.</p><h4><b>2. Maintain your vehicle</b></h4><p>Making sure your car is as efficient as possible is another top tip for saving fuel. This means getting it regularly serviced and ensuring your tyre pressure is adequate on a regular basis.</p><h4><b>3. Think about how you park</b></h4><p>Many motorists don’t consider that where they park can affect their fuel consumption. From trying to find a parking spot that takes the least manoeuvres to get out of, to parking facing the sun in order to defrost the windscreen, some hypermilers will do everything they can to save on their fuel bill.</p><h4><b>4. Remove excess weight from the boot</b></h4><p>Carrying around more weight in your car will drag down its efficiency over time. Removing any unneeded items from the boot and other areas of the vehicle can help maximise your mileage.</p><h4><b>5. Alter your driving style</b></h4><p>Most of the energy wastage that occurs while driving happens when you brake. This means if you try and maintain a consistent speed and look ahead to save having to slam on the brakes, you can save tremendous amounts of fuel.</p><p>Many hypermilers try to allow their car to naturally slow down where possible, minimising brake use. While this requires a good deal of anticipation, it can be one of the most effective ways to save fuel, alongside smooth acceleration and steering.</p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tor5iWwW610mafsqiVp7qquMinnmaemauybsDOqWSdqpmrtq%2BzjK2gqatdqbWiwIycmKdlo5bDpnnYqKxmpZ%2Bjsrp5zqdkn62VoXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

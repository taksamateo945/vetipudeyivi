Where did the time go Poo? You grew up to be such a Beautiful Young Lady. I remember the day my water broke-OMG!! It was the scariest feeling in the world. We lived in Winston Salem at the time, and Papa Joe had left the house for a second and so I called the ambulance. Zi, I was terrified because I was so young and I wanted to give you the world, but I didn’t know how I was going to do it.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bxiesp0FBID/</p><p>She continued with: “I Love You Baby Girl ❤️ having a hard time with this 18 thing. Have a Blast tonight and remember always walk with class&nbsp;@onlyzion_.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BzgJNUWHUjN/</p><p>One fan had this reaction: “I named her Zion Quari, and I already told her what the Zion means. It’s the place where the Disciples would go and pray. So I told her lil mama got to be good to deserve a name like that “ 😍💜 happy birthday pooh.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B07KZMdnji8/</p><p>Another said: “I will never forget when you were signing on American Idol, and the camera went to her, and she had tears rolling cause she feels you singing your heart out for y’all to have a better life. ❤️❤️ Happy birthday Zion. 🎁🎉🎂”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B05uxHIn0Hq/</p><p>This backer wrote: “I’ll never forget the day you won idol, my mom, sis and I screamed and jumped for joy because your story was so similar to my cousins&nbsp;@your1andonly_jai(everybody swear y’all look alike as her daughters name starts with a Z too lol) and you felt like a part of our family. Your only thought was your baby girl…they panned the camera to her and back to you, and you mouthed the words, “I did it for YOU baby.” Happy 18th Birthday to Zion.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Fantasia has also grown as a mother.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeWlru1rdKimGaakae%2FqrrOZqqhmaKawG66xK%2Bcq2WSmrOwvsRmqp6dnmK9qbvTqKpmp5Zitaa%2BjJ2Yrp%2BYqbKzedmipqdloaqus7WMm5irqpmjvG67zWafnqpdZoW1tIyboKusmJmuunnAp5tmnailuaK1zaxksKCpYsCpsYyiqmarkZl6oq7OrqtmrJiaeqO1xmakoqSVqMGwusRmampoZGyGcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

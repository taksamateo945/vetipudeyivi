ESPN's Adam Schefter noted the Bengals' star receiver duo was not present on the first day of voluntary OTAs as both players seek new contracts.
Higgins' contract situation has been well-documented this offseason. The Bengals used the franchise tag, which will guarantee him $21.8 million, to keep him from becoming a free agent."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The Bengals used the <a href=# rel=noopener>franchise tag</a>, which will guarantee him $21.8 million, to keep him from becoming a free agent.</p><p>Given how quickly Cincinnati applied the tag—it was announced on Feb. 26, well ahead of the March 5 deadline to do so—it seemed to suggest the two sides weren't close to a long-term deal.</p><p>Per <a href=# rel=noopener>Kelsey Conway</a> of the <i>Cincinnati Enquirer</i>, one recent offer from the Bengals "never approached" $20 million per season, and it was so low that Higgins' representatives didn't bother to discuss guaranteed money with the club.</p><p>Higgins has requested a trade from the Bengals but also <a href=# rel=noopener>acknowledged</a> he anticipates playing for the team in 2024 before becoming a free agent next offseason.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Conway</a> reported on April 29 that Higgins was seeking a deal similar to the three-year, $70 million contract Michael Pittman Jr. signed with the Indianapolis Colts this offseason.</p><p>Chase's deal comes with less urgency because he has two years remaining on his rookie contract. This offseason is the first time he's eligible to sign a long-term extension.</p><p>One potential complicating factor for the Bengals is Chase has <a href=# rel=noopener>suggested</a> he wants to wait until after Justin Jefferson signs his next contract.</p><p>Schefter <a href=#>said</a> last week on <i>SportsCenter </i>that whenever Jefferson eventually signs a new deal with the Minnesota Vikings, it will make him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL.</p><p>San Francisco 49ers star Nick Bosa is currently the <a href=# rel=noopener>highest-paid</a> non-quarterback after signing a five-year, $170 million extension last September.</p><p>Considering this is only the voluntary portion of the offseason activities, the Bengals don't have to be overly concerned that neither player is participating.</p><p>The next big event on the offseason calendar for the Bengals is mandatory minicamp from June 11-13. If Chase decides to skip that, then there might be the possibility of a holdout by the time training camp starts in July.</p><p>Higgins' situation is a little more complicated because he hasn't signed the franchise tender. The Bengals could receive a trade offer between now and the start of the season that's too good to pass up.</p><p>In their first two seasons as teammates in 2021 and 2022, Chase and Higgins both surpassed the 1,000-yard mark and combined for 35 touchdown receptions.</p><p>Injuries limited Higgins to 12 games last season, but he still averaged a career-high 15.6 yards per reception. Chase led the Bengals with 1,216 receiving yards and seven touchdowns.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmeEeIWMo5immaKneqS0wKycZqyVmnqptcagoKerXai4qryMm5ynn5GhwG7CzqWsp6yRp8Zuu9OaqmaZnZ6xbq%2FOp6urmZOperPBzKiprA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

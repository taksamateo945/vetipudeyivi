Everyone is trying to figure out who is related to who. It turns out that&nbsp;TV Shows Ace thinks that they have figured out who Karsyn really is and who her celebrity relative might be.</p><h3>Get To Know Karsyn</h3><p>Karsyn’s last name is Elledge and she wanted to be a race car driver. On&nbsp;Claim To Fame, she told them that her celebrity relative was a musician, but that wasn’t the truth. Instead, he is a famous race car driver and she planned to follow in his footsteps. She went to Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis and was actually a cheerleader, but that wasn’t her life-long dream.</p><p>She shared once saying, “I thought adults had everything figured out, and now I am an adult and I have no idea what I’m doing. I mean, I know I want to be a race car driver. But my Plan B, I have to have that figured out, and I have no clue.”</p><p>Karsyn of&nbsp;Claim To Fame revealed that she thinks her racing career might be over. Here is what she had to say:</p><p>“Honestly, I don’t know…I think yes. I loved driving, I loved being at the race track, I go now and watch Jason (McDougal) and watch my friends, and I don’t wish that I was out there. And I feel like that’s how I know that stage of my life has passed. It was fun, it was a great hobby, but for my brain’s sake, I’m going to go ahead and say I am officially retired.”</p><p></p><h3>Who Is Karsyn Related To?</h3><p>It turns out that Karsyn is related to race car driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. and of course, also Dale Earnhardt Sr. Sport Casting posted all about her and her relatives. Her uncle is Dale Jr. and her grandfather is Dale Sr. Her mom is Dale Jr.’s sister Kelley Earnhardt Miller.</p><p>Her mom Kelley is vice president and co-owner of JR Motorsports. It sounds like Karsyn is going to end up going into the business side of racing instead of actually being on the track just like her mom. It makes sense considering her mom has done so great at it. She already has her own clothing line called Raceline. Now she can add being on reality TV to her resume. As a child, Karsyn would hold the microphone and interview people so you never know what she will end up doing.</p><p>Do you think that Karsyn is related to Dale Earnhardt Jr.?

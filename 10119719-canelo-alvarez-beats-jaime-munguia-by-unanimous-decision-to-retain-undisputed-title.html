He was aggressive in the early rounds and got the attention of fans, analysts and his opponent:</p>Dan Rafael <span class=acct>@DanRafael1</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Rd 2: Munguia 10-9. Excellent close hard hitting round. Slight edge to Munguia but close. Both guys getting their offense in gear. Going to be a gooood fight. 1-1 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/boxing?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#boxing&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CaneloMunguia?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CaneloMunguia&lt;/a></p><p>Munguia learned that aggression against Àlvarez is a double-edged sword. It provided the avenue for success but it also put him on the mat in the fourth round, creating an inflection point in the championship bout.</p>Premier Boxing Champions <span class=acct>@premierboxing</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Canelo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Canelo&lt;/a> detonates a right uppercut that sends Munguia to the canvas in RD4! &lt;br>&lt;br>Order &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CaneloMuguia?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CaneloMuguia&lt;/a> on PBC PPV at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PrimeVideo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PrimeVideo&lt;/a> NOW: &lt;a href="https://t.co/Eo0ySuxiFd">https://t.co/Eo0ySuxiFd&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/y7rZlNk3nT">pic.twitter.com/y7rZlNk3nT&lt;/a></p><p>Munguia's cardio became a bigger plotline as the fight progressed through the middle rounds. His combination punching was giving Canelo some issues, but his output started to wane as rounds wore on.</p>Al Bernstein <span class=acct>@AlBernstein</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>canelo's granite chin is a key element of this fight. and Canelo is fighting a very good defensive fight. Munguia is a very good combination puncher, but can't sustain it through an entire round now.</p><p>Meanwhile, Canelo continued to build up steam. The superstar took everything his opponent had to offer but his talent started to shine through. Many of Munguia's punches were hitting the high guard of the champion while the champ's punches were consistently hitting their mark.</p><p>Ultimately, Àlaverez's Fight IQ, defense and smart pacing separated him from the challenger.</p>Steve Kim (Pres. of the Elija Lofton Fan Club) <span class=acct>@SteveKim323</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Munguia is trying his best, I just dont see him being able to puncture Canelo, who is just a poised, wily ol' veteran.

He never really wavered from his aggressive gameplan and continue to bring the fight to the champion. However, the knockdown turned out to be a turning point.</p><p>Canelo took control of the fight from that moment in the fourth round and consistently landed the better shots.</p><p>Àlvarez has typically turned Cinco de Mayo weekend into a marquee attraction in the boxing world. He's used the date as the platform for his wins over John Ryder, Billy Joe Saunders and Daniel Jacobs in recent years.</p><p>It was also the date for his loss to Dmitry Bivol in 2022.</p><p>Another strong performance from Àlvarez is good for the star and it's good for the sport of boxing. He remains one of the sport's biggest draws and there are still some big fights to make for him.</p><p>Specificially, a rematch with Bivol would be one of the biggest fights the sport could make right now.</p><p>However, there could be other matters for him to attend to in his current weight class that would prevent a move up.</p><p>The WBA recently named Edgar Berlanga <a href=# rel=noopener>a mandatory challenger</a>. Berlanga (22-0, 17 KOs) would be a viable candidate to see Canelo next, but there's more money to be made with a potential matchup against rising star David Benavidez or a rematch with Bivol.</p><p>Àlvarez <a href=#>recently noted</a> that he's open to a fight with Benavidez in an appearance on <i>First Take </i>with ESPN's Stephen A. Smith.</p><p>"We'll see, why not? If the money is correct, why not? I can fight him Saturday night, too," Álvarez said in the lead-up to this bout.</p><p>Regardless of who winds up being next, it's clear that Canelo can still be the king of his division right now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYW6EcoWMnJinnZykeqK41ZqpnrJdl7KiwNJmoZqhnZp6rsHNoKyimV2Xxm7BzZqloqWfqsBusMScoKyhn6N6tbuMq5ytmZmjera6w6Kqqa2kmrFuwMito54%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

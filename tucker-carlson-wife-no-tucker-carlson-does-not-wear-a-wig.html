He’s hosted MSNBC’s&nbsp;Tucker&nbsp;and co-hosted CNN’s&nbsp;Crossfire. And&nbsp;<a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href=# rel="nofollow noopener" data-ylk="slk:since Bill O’Reilly’s disgraceful departure">since Bill O’Reilly’s disgraceful departure</a>&nbsp;in 2017 from the network, he currently hosts&nbsp;Tucker Carlson Tonight&nbsp;on Fox News. Carlson has also participated in&nbsp;Dancing with the Stars.</p><p>Though his conservative political views are aired daily on television, what do we know about his personal life&nbsp;— specifically Tucker Carlson’s family?</p><p>Who is Tucker Carlson’s wife, Susan Andrews? Here are 7 things to know about Andrews and her marriage to Carlson.</p><h2>1. They’ve known&nbsp;each other since they were 15.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.iGb3MF4PsTGUEdLWNnN3g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtjZj13ZWJw/media.zenfs.com/en/yourtango_760/760d7d163577e209141e1451c434c573><p>Carlson has&nbsp;<a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href=# rel="nofollow noopener" data-ylk="slk:talked about Andrews in interviews">talked about Andrews in interviews</a>, recalling the first time they saw one another during the first week of 10th grade.</p><p>“She was the cutest 10th grader in America,” he said. His wife also felt the same, remembering, “There was a bounce in his walk. He was in his khaki pants and ribbon belt and I thought, even then, he seemed so optimistic and positive.”</p><h2>2. She was the headmaster’s daughter.</h2><p><a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href=# rel="nofollow noopener" data-ylk="slk:Susan’s father">Susan’s father</a>, Rev. George E. Andrews II, was headmaster of St. George’s School from 1984 to 1988. Carlson definitely had some chutzpah, because it’s not easy to deal with that kind of patriarchal pressure.</p><h2>3. Tucker asked for Susan’s father’s permission to marry her.</h2><p><a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href=# rel="nofollow noopener" data-ylk="slk:Tucker attended Trinity College">Tucker attended Trinity College</a>&nbsp;in Hartford, CT, but continued a long-distance relationship with Andrews. And six months before his college graduation, he worked up enough courage to ask for Andrew’s hand in marriage.</p><p>Of his decision, Carlson recalled, “All very 19th Century, but a good thing to do.”</p><h2>4. They’ve been married for 28 years.</h2><p>Though the couple married in 1991, they’ve been together over 30 years! Talk about a successful marriage.</p><h2>5. They have four children.</h2><p>The couple are parents to three daughters:&nbsp;Dorothy, Lillie, and Hopie&nbsp;and a son, Buckley. Andrews is a stay-at-home mom.&nbsp;Andrews also admits that Carlson would read to their children when they were toddlers.</p><h2>6. Andrew’s father landed in hot water after not reporting a teacher accused of sexual assault.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>When a choirmaster was accused of inappropriate sexual behavior with a student in the 1980s,&nbsp;the Diocese of Southeast Florida called for an independent&nbsp;<a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href=# rel="nofollow noopener" data-ylk="slk:investigation into Rev. Andrews in 2016">investigation into Rev. Andrews in 2016</a>. Though Andrews fired the choirmaster, he never reported it to authorities, but&nbsp;under Rhode Island’s laws, Rev. Andrews didn’t break the law.</p><p>Rev.&nbsp;Andrews’ lawyer, Michael J. Connolly, said Andrews wasn’t aware of the severity of the abuse, with over one dozen former students making accusations.&nbsp;“Does he regret what happened? Does he wish he had done more? Of course he does. He is sickened by what he read in that report,” Connolly said.</p><h2>7. Andrews stood by Tucker when he was accused of rape.</h2><p>In the early 2000s, a woman named Kimberly Carter&nbsp;<a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href=# rel="nofollow noopener" data-ylk="slk:falsely accused Tucker of raping her in a Kentucky pizzeria">falsely accused Tucker of raping her in a Kentucky pizzeria</a>. Though the accusation could have easily ended Carlson’s career and marriage, Carter later apologized, admitting she had a mental disorder that made her think he&nbsp;had assaulted her.</p><h2>8. In 2018, Andrews was home when protestors tried to break their family home.</h2><p>In November 2018, a mob of protestors tried to break into Carlson’s home in Washington D.C. Andrews had been the only one home at the time and had assumed that it was a home invasion, so she locked herself in the pantry and called 911.</p><p><a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href=# rel="nofollow noopener" data-ylk="slk:In an interview">In an interview</a>, Carlson explained the incident, saying, “I called my wife.&nbsp;She had been in the kitchen alone getting ready to go to dinner and she heard pounding on the front door and screaming… Someone started throwing himself against the front door and actually cracked the front door.”</p><p>Carlson also gave further details about the incident itself:&nbsp;“It wasn’t a protest. It was a threat.&nbsp;They weren’t protesting anything specific that I had said. They weren’t asking me to change anything. They weren’t protesting a policy or advocating for legislation… They were threatening me and my family and telling me to leave my own neighborhood in the city that I grew up in.”</p><h2 id=does-tucker-carlson-wear-a-wig-his-hair-fake-or-real>Does Tucker Carlson Wear A Wig – His Hair Fake Or Real?</h2><p>Tucker Carlson does not wear a wig, as confirmed by our sources.</p><p>Discussions on his hair being real or wig is one of the reasons behind his popularity.</p><p></p><p>His viewers are often torn between two sides, one saying Carlson wears a wig while the other support Carlson’s hair as real hair.</p><p>The majority of people have come forward saying Carlson’s hair is indeed a real deed and not a wig in a&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Reddit&nbsp;</a>discussion.</p><p>Moreover, the Fox News star has frequently pulled his hair to prove that it’s his real hair.</p><p>Considering his age and the uncanny similarity between his hair and a wig, Carlson has not been able to escape from the rumors that he wears a wig.</p><h2 id=follow-tucker-carlson-on-instagram>Follow Tucker Carlson On Instagram</h2><p>Tucker Carlson is available on Instagram under the username<a href=# rel=noopener>&nbsp;@tuckercarlsontonight</a>&nbsp;with a verified tick on the side.</p><p>Not to be surprised, he has garnered more than 1.8 million followers due to his presence in the news industry.</p><p>The whole of America is hooked on his political news presentation, for sure.</p><p>However, the Instagram handle is only for his professional use.</p><p>Carlson does not share any posts on his personal life events on the Instagram mentioned above handle.</p><p>A professional man that he is, he has resorted to private life regarding his personal and family matters.</p><p>He definitely knows how to balance his fame-filled work life and personal life.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#><span>Dr Tahir Shamsi Death Cause Revealed: How Did He Passed Away?

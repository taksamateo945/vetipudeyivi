You'd think that this might make it difficult for her to work out. However, Smalls has a trick that she uses to stay in shape on the road. "I always make sure whatever hotel I'm staying in has a gym," she revealed to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#><span>Harper's Bazaar</span></a><span>. "And then I work out for 30 minutes or an hour with a little bit of cardio and core work, and I hit my glutes and legs."</span></p><p><span>Smalls revealed some of her wellness secrets to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#><span>E! News</span></a><span>. She says that there is one type of exercise that she prioritizes the most. "Cardio is important. I used to box, and I still do some at times." "<span>Healthy adults should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week, or an equal combination of moderate and vigorous activity. To provide even greater health benefit and to assist with weight loss or maintaining weight loss, at least 300 minutes a week is recommended. That doesn't have to be all at one time, though. For example, brisk walking for 30 minutes, five days a week meets the guidelines. Aerobic exercise can even be done in short blocks of time, such as several walk breaks spread throughout the day. Any activity is better than none at all," says the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Mayo Clinic</a>.</span></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/shutterstock_663298132.jpg><p><span>Smalls makes sure to eat healthy, and there's one food group she incorporates heavily in her diet. "Eat veggies, lots and lots of veggies," she says to E! News. Smalls also shared one of her tips to getting more veggies in your diet. "A good tip is to substitute some of the larger portions of what you love, and that's not always best for you, with more veggies."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/GettyImages-1399432278.jpg><p><span>Smalls tells E! News that while she eats healthy, she doesn't like to put herself on a restrictive diet. Instead, Smalls just watches her portion sizes for each meal. </span><span>"I don't believe in dieting because I'm Puerto Rican, and it's really hard to not eat what you love. It's in my blood to eat rice and beans, so I've learned to manage portions, because you get to eat a little bit of what you absolutely love and crave."&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/GettyImages-1395826536.jpg><p><span>For Smalls, skincare is an all day routine. She tells Harper's Bazaar that there is one product that she makes sure to apply each day. "I love Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair, the serum. I always mix that in with my moisturizer. Even though the bottle says 'Night,' I still use it throughout the day so I get the benefits all the time."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxko6eRo3q0ucClo6xlmaN6o63ToaCnn12owqrAjKKqZqqVmLWivsaipaBn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

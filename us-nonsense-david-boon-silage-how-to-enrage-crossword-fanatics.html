If a phrase has made its home here, then a puzzle cameo is fair game.</p><p>American spelling is a different ball of wax, of course. Shirley Beaver, for one, was miffed by another grid’s aberration. Again, the email cut to the chase: “There’s only one ‘s’ in focused and in focusing.” Once more, the claim is half-right, as focus in its extended forms can carry one or two esses, the Macquarie endorsing both. Unlike traveler (American) or cozy (ditto), there’s no ruling on “the right way versus their way”.</p><p>Every few weeks, tackling the mailbag, I’m struck by the loyalist subgenre that is puzzle correspondence. Each solver has a unique perception of English. Or sport for that matter. Take David Boon. The Tasmanian was less an opener for the Australian XI than a first-drop batsman, argued Paul Edwards.</p><p>You won’t find me at Sydney Airport, sifting luggage for vernacular contraband.</p><p>Boon, the name, was part of a cryptic charade leading to boondocks. Yet Paul was stumped by the wordplay. Boonie was a reliable Number 3, and not a “legendary opener” as my clue alluded. Stats from the Test arena supported the hunch, said Paul.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.081%2C$multiply_0.4233%2C$ratio_0.666667%2C$width_378%2C$x_22%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/b58487dba8bab5a49bd82b4086b8a7206fdd9435><p>Focusing on limited overs, however, Boon opened Australia’s one-day innings 118 of 177 outings, which verges on opener status. Some solvers will own an Anglo bias as much as a disdain for athletes in pyjamas. Though I loved Paul’s suggestion should Boon recur: “Perhaps an alternate clue would be ‘an Australian record-holder at 30,000 feet’.”</p><p>Meanwhile Ed Robins waved a cranky pitchfork back in March, due to my 19-across: “Green crops fed to confined livestock (7)”. The answer was SOILAGE, which made Ed seethe: “DA – no! Green crops are ensilaged (put into silos) and become SILAGE for stockfeed! I’ve carted enough tons of the stuff and read enough Weekly Times articles to know. Soilage is what might happen if you step in silage in your new white sneakers! Please submit your humble apology!”</p><p>The late novelist Peter Temple supported Ed’s argument too. Late in Temple’s Broken Shore (Text, 2005), a fringe character “planned to turn his uncle and aunt into silage and feed them to the pigs”. Barbaric, yes, but it does honour the Macquarie, where silage is “green fodder preserved in a silo or mound”. Not that my soilage clue is wrong, since the same source defines the word as “freshly cut green fodder for animals kept in a confined area”.</p><p>Source: | This article originally belongs to <a href=#>smh.com.au</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpah6r7vNrJynq5VisaLCyJ1km6efo3q0tcuanp5lmKTEbsDOZpynqpGcsm6v0aiqrK%2Bfp7FussCnmK2hk6h8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
